# TicketViewerBackEnd
**The project is in the master branch!!!**   
  
Please review Front-end in another project **TicketViewerFrontEnd**.  
   
The TicketViewer back-end is based on Spring Boot.  
In the project, it receive the request from the Front-end. In the request, it receive Username, Password and Subdomain.   
Then, we make a request to Zendesk Server, and add the parameters to the header. Then it return tickets.   

// Plus, I find that it has been paged by the Meta and Links attributes. Thus, I make a for loop to request until it does not have next page.  

For using this project:  
1.Download the project to your computer.  
2.Open a terminal, then enter the folder of the project. (You can open another terminal to run Front-end project).   
3.Enter code **"mvn spring-boot:run"** to run the Back-end.   
   
Final:
Thanks for reviewing my project!
